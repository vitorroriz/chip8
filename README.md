# chip8
A Chip-8 emulator - This is a work in progress (WIP)

My goals is to develop my first emulator to get experience and maybe one day develop a game boy emulator. More experienced people usually recommend starting by the Chip8, since it is quite simple and has a short instruction set, so that's what I did.
