A Chip-8 emulator - This is a work in progress (WIP)

My goals is to develop my first emulator to get experience and maybe one day develop a game boy emulator. More experienced people usually recommend starting by the Chip8, since it is quite simple and has a short instruction set, so that's what I did.

While this is still WIP, it can pass the BC_test from BestCoder [bestcoder@ymail.com] (https://github.com/vitorroriz/chip8/tree/main/rom), as seen below:

It can also run Space Invaders (David Winter), although gameplay still has bugs:
